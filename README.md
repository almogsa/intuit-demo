# Social Player 
## Installation 
## Client: 
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

## Server: 
### `cd Server`
### `npm install`
### `npm start`
## LIVE DEMO
 https://intuit-player.herokuapp.com
## CLIENT IMPLEMENTATION:
    duplicate songs are not allowed
    the url should be a valid for youtube ( there is a verification)
    support on mobile devices 
## SEVER IMPLEMENTATION:
    1. In my implementation All the data on the server is essentially volatile, if you were to restart the application, all data would be lost.
    Addtionaly, it would not scale across multiple server instances.
    2. A little more complex solution: Store all playlist in a database and query the database to retrieve the last playlist when a user connects.
    Pros: All data is persistent and if the server were to crash/be stopped, you still would be able to retrieve the data.
    3. Last solution can be implemented by Redis which is in-memory data structure store

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
